# OS Projects

This repository contains three **Operating System-related** projects implemented in **Java**:

## 📌 Project Descriptions

### 🏛️ Distributed Transaction System  
Implements a **Two-Phase Commit Protocol**, where a **client** interacts with a **server** to manage transaction states and ensure **atomicity** in a distributed environment.

### ⏳ Clock Synchronization System  
Implements a **logical clock synchronization algorithm**, where **clients** send timestamps to a **server**, which adjusts and returns the **synchronized time**.

### ⚖️ Iterative vs. Concurrent Server Performance Comparison  
Compares an **iterative server** (handling **one request at a time**) and a **concurrent server** (handling **multiple requests using multithreading**) to measure **performance differences**.
